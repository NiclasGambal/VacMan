## VacMan
# Background
In one of my first modules called ProgOO, in the end we had two project weeks to create a game. 
The product of these two weeks is this PacMan variant. I had a lot of fun by coding it and so 
I went on after the two weeks finished to implement such a thing like a better search algo for
the ghost and stuff like that.

# Features
There are not that many features, but you can build own maps in JSON format to be played, but yeah,
pretty basic stuff :D

# Known bugs
There is problem with the high resolution version, but I think its just the library, dont have time
to try fix it anyway...

# Who worked on it?
I created it together with a friend and fellow student of mine.

# Updates?
There are currently no updates planned.
